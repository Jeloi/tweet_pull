2 @LadyCrystalB I think I'm living the most present &amp; aware I have ever lived &amp; that made this time even better. Maybe I've finally grown up?

3 @theharryshearer I don't think I've ever dribbled a pearl.  I am often disgusting on stage.  Beyond wrong.  and not always funny.
3 @theharryshearer Absolutely.  And the explosion itself is an educational result.  Not a failure.
3 @theharryshearer Lenny had a bit about DH Lawrence vs. porn mags.  saying that the porn guy goes to jail for poor writing skill.
3 @theharryshearer Harry.  I think you are the apex of where funny and smart meet.  I'd love to discuss this with you further.
3 I guess I felt like I was hearing just the one thing about this over and over again.  I just said something different.
3 here's what I think is great.  Folks are talking.  It's stimulating and it opens doors.
3 @theharryshearer I laughed at Lenny too.  But if I didn't, it's still comedy.  It's a pretty tricky chemistry experiment.
3 @theharryshearer I did at some of it.  yes.  Not at all of it.
3 I would love to say I was wrong, because that means I've grown.  I don't feel that yet, but I'm listening.
3 this whole thing has been a fascinating learning experience. @tanehisi wrote a great piece that I don't completely agree with.
3 @theharryshearer all of these words, including funny, need a "to" and then a subject afterwards, don't they?
3 @theharryshearer @MiltShook yes it can.  Often.  and kind simultaneously.  But sometimes just cruel.
3 @theharryshearer Okay. Funny.  Can I have another one?
3 @theharryshearer  I'd say the distinction is comedy vs. political statements.  Is there no distinction there in your mind?
3 @rogerbinion nothing unless he farts as you stab him and has fudge all over his fat little face.  dude no one stabbed anyone.
3 okay now really that's all.  Unless I think of something else.

3 @ImekaSF because last night i got FUCKED UP!
3 @davidjohnsonpdx We reserve the right to cancel any ticket that is resold at higher than face value and I think that's keeping them away.
3 @seymours99 that's amazing.  Ten times?  Shit.  thank you.
3 @cutterwhite we couldn't find a venue in LA that would use our tix service and had the right dates.  Tough. I want to play there.

3 not a single ticket on stubhub.  If u see over-priced tix to this tour ANYWHERE, buying is a big risk.  It will be invalid at showtime.
3 and of course, tickets are still available ONLY at http://t.co/BGG6h2Vw.  45 bucks, all in, all seats, all cities, all new jokes
3 If I turn up dead, and you wonder who did me in... well... follow the money.  Ha ha. No.  But seriously please don't shoot me.

3 well.  after 45 hours, my tour has sold 100K tickets, box office gross of 4.5 mil $ (not all mine). I guess it was a good idea.
3 Sorry there's a slight delay in Austin new shows.  Also the technical issues in DC are our fault but will be resumed shortly
3 Lotsa Shows are all selling out.  We just added more shows in NYC, Dallas, Austin and Chicago. So get  Tix only at louisck,com
3 please remember, LOUIE season 3 premieres This THURSDAY, 6/28 at 10:30pm on FX.  This season is really different and good.
3 @TheChrisPierce don't touch those.  they're worthless. (except toronto and Trump.  that's not us)
3 We're tracking down scalped tickets and deactivating them.  Don't let it deactivate in your hand after you paid too much for it.
3 my tour tix are ONLY at http://t.co/BGG6h2Vw.  if you buy overprice tix from a reseller it won't work at the turnstile.  Don't get fucked
3 @NightSand who's selling them?  I woiuldn't if I were you because as soon as that happens we can deactivate the ticket and you'll be fucked.
3 Hey I'm on the tonight show in a minute so watch NBC.  Gotta stop questions now.  Remember http://t.co/BGG6h2Vw for tourtix.

4 .@rcalo @kashhill @GregoryMcNeal signing off now. Thanks for the questions! Follow us &amp; tweet any more drone qs directly to us. #AskForbes
4 Closing thoughts @rcalo: Flying smartphones---I think this will come to matter for these reasons: http://t.co/4LyCay3bfx #AskForbes
4 Closing thoughts @kashhill: Looking fwd to seeing Amazon's drones go to battle w/ Google's driverless cars for delivery dominance #AskForbes
4 .@AtoArora Depends on energy source. Better batteries &amp; some tweaks to the quad architecture could mean quieter drones. - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@Smokey1834 GPS signal software will tell it to return to base, hover until it recovers signal, or land. - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@lukasdmiller FAA will require "sense &amp; avoid" tech so this may cause other drones to steer clear. - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@Matt_Cagle ...and actually increases privacy: http://t.co/IRYZRyU905 @kashhill #AskForbes
4 .@Matt_Cagle I'm intrigued by a peer-to-peer drone delivery system that subverts post office tracking...  - @kashhill #AskForbes
4 .@Matt_Cagle My worry is that police will ask Amazon for all of their footage in a given neighborhood (usually bad ones) - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@lukasdmiller They take great footage&amp; ppl love making videos. Protests in Bangkok via drone: http://t.co/QgXuZi2IBO - @kashhill #AskForbes
4 .@lukasdmiller Real disruption will be when drones are flying smartphones with 3rd party apps http://t.co/icueBE8B8K - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@Clintonio Your dad and this guy would get along very well: http://t.co/lbA2YarsWB - @kashhill #AskForbes
4 .@Clintonio Shooting down a drone (defined as an aircraft) gets you 20 years in jail: http://t.co/JBALC08yPd - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@Clintonio You own the airspace you can reasonably use but shooting down drones could still open you up to liability. - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@finanz101 Insurance will play big role in robotics. Amazon would hold general, not per drone, insurance policy. - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@CaptainMadz Hopefully not likely but accidents are inevitable. Hundreds of people die a year from falling out of bed. - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@CaptainMadz While these will be small drones, people could still be injured. - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@CaptainMadz Safety is the FAAs primary focus in their roadmap. http://t.co/ej7ocX7GKz - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@AmineBenNjima Here's @a_greenberg's piece on a drone that would be able to hack back: http://t.co/0tNPtDNuaG - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@AmineBenNjima Similar to what happens if someone steals from a doorstep, but drone will have GPS tracking - @GregoryMcNeal #AskForbes
4 .@AmineBenNjima Drones have been successfully hacked in the past.: http://t.co/kD56rNRnaM - @kashhill #AskForbes
4 .@JoshuaWO3 The law against damaging property is a kind of defense as well. - @rcalo #AskForbes
4 .@JoshuaWO3 When do drones get weapons of self defense? Probably hard to shoot. Going to have tracking equipment. - @kashhill #AskForbes
4 .@CaptainMadz It won't be legal, per FAA rules, until 2015 at the earliest. Amazon says it's aiming for 5yrs from now - @kashhill #AskForbes
