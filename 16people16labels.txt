10  @theharryshearer I don't think I've ever dribbled a pearl.  I am often disgusting on stage.  Beyond wrong.  and not always funny.
10  @theharryshearer Absolutely.  And the explosion itself is an educational result.  Not a failure.
10  @theharryshearer Lenny had a bit about DH Lawrence vs. porn mags.  saying that the porn guy goes to jail for poor writing skill.
10  @theharryshearer Harry.  I think you are the apex of where funny and smart meet.  I'd love to discuss this with you further.
10  I guess I felt like I was hearing just the one thing about this over and over again.  I just said something different.
10  here's what I think is great.  Folks are talking.  It's stimulating and it opens doors.
10  @theharryshearer I laughed at Lenny too.  But if I didn't, it's still comedy.  It's a pretty tricky chemistry experiment.
10  @theharryshearer I did at some of it.  yes.  Not at all of it.
10  I would love to say I was wrong, because that means I've grown.  I don't feel that yet, but I'm listening.
10  this whole thing has been a fascinating learning experience. @tanehisi wrote a great piece that I don't completely agree with.
10  @theharryshearer all of these words, including funny, need a "to" and then a subject afterwards, don't they?
10  @theharryshearer @MiltShook yes it can.  Often.  and kind simultaneously.  But sometimes just cruel.
10  @theharryshearer Okay. Funny.  Can I have another one?
10  @theharryshearer  I'd say the distinction is comedy vs. political statements.  Is there no distinction there in your mind?
10  @rogerbinion nothing unless he farts as you stab him and has fudge all over his fat little face.  dude no one stabbed anyone.
10  okay now really that's all.  Unless I think of something else.
10  It is clear to anyone with an ability to reason and understand people that he didn't mean a word of what he said.  he was fucking around.
10  @hana_duel that's your opinion.
10  That's all.  Have a nice day.
10  If every word a person says has to be right and balanced and fair, I will jump off a tall thing onto a hard place.
10  thought 2. Tracey Morgan is ridiculous and I love watching him just go to wrongful and crazy places in his mind and I can laugh.
10  I can have two thoughts simultaneously.  1. Gay people have a right to grow up and live in confidence happiness, honesty and equality.
10  you have a right to be offended, sound off.  As a man who hates violence and discrimination against gays or anyone, I was not offended.
10  Tracey Morgan said something wrong, evil, cruel, ignorant and hilarious.  He was on a comedy stage, not at a pulpit.
10  What do u call it if you're very comfortable changing the color of a red root vegetable?

12  Once Regis retires, I’ll have no more competition for weirdest first name on the air.
12  On tonight’s show, Cheryl Hines undresses me with her eyes. Then dresses me again. And adds a hat.
12  In North America yesterday, for a few seconds, the entire internet went down. Or, as it's known in my house, "The Day I Spoke to my Wife."

12  When I die, I just want my tombstone to read “George Clooney.” That ought to pull in some visitors.
12  I want to apologize to all the people of Tampa for my last tweet. I’m sure Tampa is a fine place to live, if you’re a mosquito.
12  Remember, Red Sox fans, they still have to live in Tampa.
12  The sonic clarity of this “cat falling in a toilet” video on YouTube is so much better with my new Bose headphones.

12  You know you’re getting older when you throw out your back while buttering scones.

12  Just learned the hard way that “Cajun-style” is not a quality you want in a proctology exam.
12  Mapquest is such a dramatic name. “Tell me, O Map Quest, how I doth get to the doughnut shop near Reggie’s house?” #slownewsday
12  It’s normal to have a breakfast chat alone in your office with the ghost of Nell Carter, right?
12  I think Newt Gingrich is the #1 candidate in the “Could be Related to Bilbo Baggins” category.
12  Where’s my Ben & Jerry’s ice cream flavor? I think people would love a bowl of “Ginger Coco Honkey Bites.”
12  Quick, remind me: in which 80s movie did Mitt Romney and Rick Perry play the school principal and the community business leader?
12  Jon Huntsman was the brightest, most articulate Republican out there last night. Better luck in '16, @JonHuntsman.
12  Freud said "Love & work are the cornerstones of our humanness." I say it's love and that show "Pawn Stars".

12  Today might be Labor Day, but I'll always remember it as the day when Tsar Peter I of Russia imposed a tax on beards.
12  Just taught my kids about taxes by eating 38% of their ice cream.

12  So far we’ve been incredibly lucky that all of our guests have something to promote.

12  Finally found the world's largest Frying Pan. My life no longer has purpose. http://t.co/oNpQJZ4
12  Woke up and read that Stan Lee is suing the movie "Conan" for ripping him off. Now my father is suing Stan Lee.
12  Just tried to donate to the @GatesFoundation. Curiously, they refused to accept my '92 Ford Taurus: http://t.co/sCTWehI
12  You say one thing @CatDeeley, but your overly physical home security team says another.
12  Look for me in a spin-off of “So You Think You Can Dance” called “So You’ve Been Stalking @CatDeeley.”
12  Tip for screenwriters: need a place for a character to breakdown and cry? Try the shower!
12  Sorry @AndersonCooper, but as long as there is blood in my scalp, my hair shall defeat yours. (Maniacal laughter)
12  Really regretting green lighting “Bring Your Marital Problems to Work Day."
12  In my old neighborhood in Boston, some nights I couldn’t sleep because of the sound of gunshots. They always came from inside the house.

12  Attention Spiders: The Ab-Flexer in my garage is an excellent location for a long-term web.
12  Just a reminder to check on your elderly relatives during these hot summer months. Hi Dad. There, my job’s done.
12  Rick Perry is a religious, right-wing conservative who’s a former pilot and the governor of Texas. Finally! One of those!
12  Mitt Romney says “Corporations are People.”  So that’s why IBM keeps calling asking me to “hang out.”
12  Newsweek apologized to Michele Bachmann for making her look crazy.  Can’t wait to see this week’s cover with Gary Busey.
