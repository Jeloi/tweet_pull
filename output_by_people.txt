10  @theharryshearer I don't think I've ever dribbled a pearl.  I am often disgusting on stage.  Beyond wrong.  and not always funny.
10  @theharryshearer Absolutely.  And the explosion itself is an educational result.  Not a failure.
10  @theharryshearer Lenny had a bit about DH Lawrence vs. porn mags.  saying that the porn guy goes to jail for poor writing skill.
10  @theharryshearer Harry.  I think you are the apex of where funny and smart meet.  I'd love to discuss this with you further.
10  I guess I felt like I was hearing just the one thing about this over and over again.  I just said something different.
10  here's what I think is great.  Folks are talking.  It's stimulating and it opens doors.
10  @theharryshearer I laughed at Lenny too.  But if I didn't, it's still comedy.  It's a pretty tricky chemistry experiment.
10  @theharryshearer I did at some of it.  yes.  Not at all of it.
10  I would love to say I was wrong, because that means I've grown.  I don't feel that yet, but I'm listening.
10  this whole thing has been a fascinating learning experience. @tanehisi wrote a great piece that I don't completely agree with.
10  @theharryshearer all of these words, including funny, need a "to" and then a subject afterwards, don't they?
10  @theharryshearer @MiltShook yes it can.  Often.  and kind simultaneously.  But sometimes just cruel.
10  @theharryshearer Okay. Funny.  Can I have another one?
10  @theharryshearer  I'd say the distinction is comedy vs. political statements.  Is there no distinction there in your mind?
10  @rogerbinion nothing unless he farts as you stab him and has fudge all over his fat little face.  dude no one stabbed anyone.
10  okay now really that's all.  Unless I think of something else.
10  It is clear to anyone with an ability to reason and understand people that he didn't mean a word of what he said.  he was fucking around.
10  @hana_duel that's your opinion.
10  That's all.  Have a nice day.
10  If every word a person says has to be right and balanced and fair, I will jump off a tall thing onto a hard place.
10  thought 2. Tracey Morgan is ridiculous and I love watching him just go to wrongful and crazy places in his mind and I can laugh.
10  I can have two thoughts simultaneously.  1. Gay people have a right to grow up and live in confidence happiness, honesty and equality.
10  you have a right to be offended, sound off.  As a man who hates violence and discrimination against gays or anyone, I was not offended.
10  Tracey Morgan said something wrong, evil, cruel, ignorant and hilarious.  He was on a comedy stage, not at a pulpit.
10  What do u call it if you're very comfortable changing the color of a red root vegetable?
